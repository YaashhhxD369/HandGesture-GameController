# 🖐️ HandGesture-GameController  

Control PC games using **hand gestures** with Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe.  
This project turns your webcam into a **virtual game controller** where simple hand movements (up, down, left, right) simulate keyboard arrow key presses.

- Control games with **arrow keys** (Up, Down, Left, Right).
- Works with any PC game that uses arrow keys.
- Smooth key holding and release using `pyautogui`.
- Visual feedback with OpenCV (shows direction text on screen).
